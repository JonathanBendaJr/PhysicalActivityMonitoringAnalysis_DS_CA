# PhysicalActivityMonitoringAnalysis_DS_CA
 Exploratory Analysis and Machine Learning on Physical Activity Monitoring Dataset  by: Jonathan S D Benda Jr    Course: Data Analytics and Algorithms (MSc Data Science)


### 1.1 Project Objectives
The objective of this research is to provide insights from the datasets produced by wearable hardware devices and/or software. The created hardware and/or software can determine the amount as well as the type of physical activity an individual (or subject) performs in making use of start/end timings and heart rates.

Some major outcomes of the project are:
1. Perform a thorough exploratory data analysis by cleaning, pre-processing, and analysing/visualizing the data.
2. Perform summary statistics to get quick insight of the data at hand.
3. To develop and test more than one hypothesis for a relationship between a pair of attributes.
4. To develop and test more than one machine learning model which uses multiple attributes to make predictions.
5. To Evaluate the accuracy of these models develop, along with it's precision and F1 scores.
